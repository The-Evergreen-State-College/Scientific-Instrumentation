title: "2024 Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS), [NIST] Instrumentation List"
---

## Summary
In 2024, The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, received $2.135 million through Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) to acquire advanced laboratory equipment for STEM research and research training programs. This funding was secured by U.S. Senator Patty Murray, formerly Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, as part of the fiscal year 2024 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, administers the funds, managing their distribution and compliance, though the funding was directed by Congress.
