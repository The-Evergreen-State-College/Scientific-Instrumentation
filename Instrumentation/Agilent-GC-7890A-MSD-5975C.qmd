## Description

The Agilent 7890A/5975C is a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) system combining capillary gas chromatography with quadrupole mass spectrometry for separation and identification of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds. The 7890A gas chromatograph features electronic pneumatic control (EPC) for precise carrier gas flow regulation, programmable temperature control up to 450°C, and support for split/splitless injection modes. The 5975C mass selective detector employs electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV and operates with a hyperbolic quadrupole mass filter providing unit mass resolution across a nominal mass range of 1.6 to 1050 amu. The detector utilizes an electron multiplier for ion detection and maintains vacuum through a turbomolecular pump system. Data acquisition and instrument control are managed through Agilent MassHunter software, which provides spectral library searching, quantitative analysis, and method development capabilities. The system is applicable to environmental analysis, forensic chemistry, pharmaceutical testing, and complex mixture characterization.
