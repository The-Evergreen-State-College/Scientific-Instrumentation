## Description

The [Leica M205 FCA](https://www.leica-microsystems.com/products/light-microscopes/stereo-microscopes/p/leica-m205-fca/) is a fluorescence stereo microscope designed for high-resolution imaging of macroscopic samples. It features a zoom range of 7.8:1 (0.64x–5x) with a maximum magnification of 160x using standard 1x objectives. The microscope uses a coded zoom system for precise magnification tracking and reproducibility. It is equipped with a fluorescence module that supports multiple filter sets for visualizing fluorescent signals across various wavelengths, suitable for applications like biological research or material inspection.The system includes a trinocular head for camera integration, enabling digital image capture. It uses LED illumination for both brightfield and fluorescence, with adjustable intensity to minimize photobleaching. The working distance ranges from 61.5 mm to 135 mm, depending on the objective, allowing flexibility for sample manipulation. The microscope has a modular design, supporting accessories like motorized focus, stages, and camera adapters for customized setups.The optical system employs apochromatic correction to reduce chromatic aberrations, providing clear and sharp images. It also features ergonomic adjustments for user comfort during extended use, including adjustable eyepieces and a tilting head option. The instrument is controlled via a combination of manual knobs and software for fluorescence settings and image acquisition.
