## Description

The Cary 60 is a compact, single-beam UV-Visible spectrophotometer designed for routine quantitative and qualitative analysis of liquid samples. The instrument employs a xenon flash lamp as the light source, providing wavelength coverage from 190 to 1100 nm. The optical system utilizes a Czerny-Turner monochromator with a fixed spectral bandwidth of 1.5 nm. Sample measurements are performed using standard 10 mm path length cuvettes in a single-cell holder. The instrument interfaces with a computer running Cary WinUV software for instrument control, data acquisition, and spectral analysis. The system is suitable for applications including concentration determination, kinetics studies, spectral scanning, and multi-component analysis.
