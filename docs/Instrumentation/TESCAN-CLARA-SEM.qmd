## Description

The [TESCAN CLARA](https://info.tescan.com/sem/clara), an ultra-high-resolution scanning electron microscope (UHR-SEM), facilitates advanced nanoscale characterization of diverse materials, including magnetic and beam-sensitive specimens. Its field-free BrightBeam™ optics enable high-contrast imaging at low beam energies, while a multidetector system distinguishes electrons by angle and energy, enhancing topographic and compositional data. The microscope’s modular architecture supports customization, accommodating specialized research requirements. The Essence™ interface, with guided workflows and In-Flight™ automation, streamlines operation and data collection. Compatible with multimodal techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, serial block face imaging, and tensile stage testing.
